This experiment has two parts. In the first part, you will be required to read
a number of English sentences one word at a time. You can advance to the next
word by pressing the space bar.
</p>
<p>
In the second part, you will be asked to “rate” some sentences
on a scale of 1-7 (with 1 bad and 7 good).
